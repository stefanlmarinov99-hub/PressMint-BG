## What can be included in a PressMint corpus

PressMint gathers corpora of historical newspapers, which should be stuctured and annotated as specified by the
[Guidelines on the structure and encoding of PressMint corpora](https://clarin-eric.github.io/PressMint/).

Apart from this, there are only a few requirements for the newspapers in a corpus:

* The texts should be copyright free, i.e. it should be possible to make the corpora avaialable on the CC BY licence.
* Each newspaper issue (or newspaper article) included in a corpus should have a known date of publication,
  i.e. including year, month and day, e.g. 1900-04-30.

## Git and GitHub

Sample data should be pushed to the Data branch of the PressMint repository directly into the samples folder
(*`Samples/PressMint-XX`*)

### Setup

- [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have one.
- [Fork PressMint repository](https://github.com/clarin-eric/PressMint/fork) into your organization or private account.
  - uncheck "Copy the main branch only"
- Start the terminal on your computer and navigate to the folder where you want the PressMint local clone of the repository to be placed:

```bash
# replace <USER-ORG> with your GitHub user or organization name
 git clone git@github.com:<USER-ORG>/PressMint.git
```

- (ONLY WHEN YOU FORGET TO UNCHECK "Copy the main branch only") Set the data branch in your repository to be synchronized with the data branch in the PressMint repository:
```bash
cd PressMint
git remote add upstream https://github.com/clarin-eric/PressMint.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b data upstream/data
git push -u origin data
```

### Adding new data into your remote repository (Fork)
- check you are in the data branch

```bash
git status
# switch do data branch:
git checkout data
```
- Update your local git repository with your remote repository

```bash
git pull
```

- Add new data to your local git repository
  - eg sample source data:  

```bash
# replace XX with your country code
git add Samples/PressMint-XX/Sources/*
git commit -m 'XX: Source sample' Samples/PressMint-XX/Sources/*
```

- Push data to your Fork:

```bash
git push
```
### Compare your changes with PressMint 

- https://github.com/clarin-eric/PressMint/compare/data...USER-ORG:PressMint:data
- then create a pull request


### Synchronize your remote repository with the PressMint repository

- update your repository with new content in PressMint repository:
  - create a pull request: https://github.com/USER-ORG/PressMint/compare/data...clarin-eric:data
  - check changes
  - merge pull request
- update PressMint repository with data in your repository:
  - create a pull request: https://github.com/clarin-eric/PressMint/compare/data...USER-ORG:data

#### Synchronization troubleshooting

Sometimes it can happen that changes are, due to a conflict, more complicated to merge. Then the easiest way is to merge upstream data, and in case of conflict, use clarin-eric/PressMint changes:

- test if upstream is set:
```bash
git remote -v | grep "upstream.*fetch"
```
expected output
```
upstream	https://github.com/clarin-eric/PressMint.git (fetch)
```
- add upstream, if not present
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/clarin-eric/PressMint.git
```
- fetch upstream, merge, and push to your remote fork
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge -X theirs upstream/data
git push
```
